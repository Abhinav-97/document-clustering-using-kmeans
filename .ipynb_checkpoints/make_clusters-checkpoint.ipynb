       "' List of To Kill a Mockingbird characters The story takes place during three years (1933–35) of the Great Depression in the fictional \"tired old town\" of Maycomb, Alabama, the seat of Maycomb County. It focuses on six-year-old Jean Louise Finch (nicknamed Scout), who lives with her older brother, Jeremy (nicknamed Jem), and their widowed father, Atticus, a middle-aged lawyer. Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer. The three children are terrified yet fascinated by their neighbor, the reclusive Arthur \"Boo\" Radley. The adults of Maycomb are hesitant to talk about Boo, and few of them have seen him for many years. The children feed one anothers imagination with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden, and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house. After two summers of friendship with Dill, Scout and Jem find that someone leaves them small gifts in a tree outside the Radley place. Several times the mysterious Boo makes gestures of affection to the children, but, to their disappointment, he never appears in person. Great Depression reclusive Judge Taylor appoints Atticus to defend Tom Robinson, a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman, Mayella Ewell. Although many of Maycombs citizens disapprove, Atticus agrees to defend Tom to the best of his ability. Other children taunt Jem and Scout for Atticuss actions, calling him a \"nigger-lover\". Scout is tempted to stand up for her fathers honor by fighting, even though he has told her not to. Atticus faces a group of men intent on lynching Tom. This danger is averted when Scout, Jem, and Dill shame the mob into dispersing by forcing them to view the situation from Atticus and Toms perspective. nigger Atticus does not want Jem and Scout to be present at Tom Robinsons trial. No seat is available on the main floor, so by invitation of the Rev. Sykes, Jem, Scout, and Dill watch from the colored balcony. Atticus establishes that the accusers—Mayella and her father, Bob Ewell, the town drunk—are lying. It also becomes clear that the friendless Mayella made sexual advances toward Tom, and that her father caught her and beat her. Despite significant evidence of Toms innocence, the jury convicts him. Jems faith in justice becomes badly shaken, as is Atticus, when the hapless Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison. colored balcony town drunk Despite Toms conviction, Bob Ewell is humiliated by the events of the trial, Atticus explaining that he \"destroyed last shred of credibility at that trial.\" Ewell vows revenge, spitting in Atticus face, trying to break into the judges house, and menacing Tom Robinsons widow. Finally, he attacks the defenseless Jem and Scout while they walk home on a dark night after the school Halloween pageant. Jem suffers a broken arm in the struggle, but amid the confusion someone comes to the childrens rescue. The mysterious man carries Jem home, where Scout realizes that he is Boo Radley. Halloween Sheriff Tate arrives and discovers that Bob Ewell has died during the fight. The sheriff argues with Atticus about the prudence and ethics of charging Jem (whom Atticus believes to be responsible) or Boo (whom Tate believes to be responsible). Atticus eventually accepts the sheriffs story that Ewell simply fell on his own knife. Boo asks Scout to walk him home, and after she says goodbye to him at his front door he disappears again. While standing on the Radley porch, Scout imagines life from Boos perspective, and regrets that they had never repaid him for the gifts he had given them. Scout then goes back home to Atticus and stays up with him for a while in Jems room. Soon Atticus takes her to bed and tucks her in, before leaving to go back to Jem. '"

As they approach the frontier William strikes up a conversation with Mr Norris, who wears an ill-fitting wig and carries a suspect passport.  William and Mr Norris succeed in crossing the frontier. Afterward, Mr Norris invites William to dinner and the two become friends. In Berlin they see each other frequently (including eating ham and eggs at the first class restaurant of Berlin Friedrichstraße railway station). Several oddities of Mr Norris\\'s personal life are revealed, one of which is that he is a masochist. Another is that he is a Communist, which is dangerous in Hitler-era Germany. Other aspects of Mr Norris\\'s personal life remain mysterious. He seems to run a business with an assistant Schmidt, who tyrannises him. Norris gets into more and more straitened circumstances and has to leave Berlin.  Berlin  Berlin Friedrichstraße railway station  Hitler  Norris subsequently returns with his fortunes restored and apparently conducting communication with an unknown Frenchwoman called Margot. Schmidt reappears and tries to blackmail Norris. Norris uses Bradshaw as a decoy to get an aristocratic friend of his, Baron Pregnitz, to take a holiday in Switzerland and meet \"Margot\" under the guise of a Dutchman. Bradshaw is urgently recalled by Ludwig Bayer (based on Willi Münzenberg)[3] one of the leaders of the Communist groups, who explains that Norris was spying for the French and both his group and the police know about it. Bradshaw observes they are being followed by the police and persuades Norris to leave Germany. After the Reichstag fire, the Nazis eliminate Bayer and most of Norris\\'s comrades. Bradshaw returns to England where he receives intermittent notes and postcards from Norris, who has fled Berlin, pursued by Schmidt.

       "' edit  The story begins with Kathy, who describes herself as a \"carer\", talking about looking after organ donors. She has been a carer for almost twelve years at the time of narration, and she often reminisces about her time spent at Hailsham, a boarding school in England, where the teachers are known as guardians. Along with classes, they often emphasize the importance of being healthy to their students—smoking is considered to be taboo, almost on the level of a crime, and working in the vegetable garden is compulsory. The curriculum appears to be like that of any other school, but there is great encouragement for the students to produce art. The art is then displayed in an exhibition, and the best artwork is chosen by a woman known to the students as Madame. The students speculate that she keeps their work in a gallery.  boarding school  The story revolves around three Hailsham students: Kathy, and two others, Ruth and Tommy, who develop a close but complicated friendship. Kathy develops a fondness for Tommy, looking after him when he is bullied and having private talks with him. However, Ruth and Tommy begin a romantic relationship during their time at the school that continues when they leave.  In an isolated incident, Miss Lucy, one of the guardians, talks to the students about their true purpose, because overheard conversations have suggested that they don\\'t grasp it: they are clones who were created to provide organs to others, a cycle of donations that will end their lives when they are still young. This results in Miss Lucy\\'s removal from the school, though it causes only subtle disturbance in the students, who are curiously accepting of their fate.  At age 16, Ruth, Tommy and Kathy move to the Cottages, a poorly maintained residential complex where they begin contact with the outside world. Ruth and Tommy continue their relationship, and Kathy has some sexual, but shallow, relationships with other men. Kathy is concerned that her sex drive is abnormal, and, when Kathy confides this to her, Ruth deliberately encourages her to feel this way.  Two older housemates, who had not been at Hailsham, tell Ruth that they have seen a \"possible\" for Ruth, an older woman who resembles Ruth and thus could be the woman from whom she was cloned. As a result, the five of them go on a trip to see her, but the two older students first want to discuss a rumour they have heard: that a couple can have their donations deferred if they can prove that they are truly in love. They believe that this privilege is for Hailsham students only and so wrongly expect that the others will know how to apply for it. They then find the possible, but the resemblance to Ruth is only superficial, causing her to wonder angrily whether they were all cloned from \"human trash\".  During the trip, Kathy and Tommy separate from the others and look for a copy of a music tape that Kathy had lost when at Hailsham. Tommy\\'s recollection of the tape and desire to find it for her make clear the depth of his feelings for Kathy. They find the tape, and then Tommy shares with Kathy a theory that the reason Madame collected their art was to determine which couples were truly in love, citing a teacher who had said that their art revealed their souls. After the trip, Kathy and Tommy do not tell Ruth of the found tape, nor of Tommy\\'s theory about the deferral.  When Ruth finds out about the tape and Tommy\\'s theory, she takes an opportunity to drive a wedge between Tommy and Kathy. Shortly afterwards she tells Kathy that even if Ruth and Tommy were to split up, Tommy would never enter into a relationship with Kathy because of her sexual history. A few weeks later, Kathy applies to become a carer, meaning that she will not see Ruth or Tommy for many years.  Ten years pass without Kathy seeing Ruth or Tommy, during which time Hailsham closes. Ruth\\'s first donation goes badly and her health deteriorates. Kathy becomes Ruth\\'s carer, and both are aware that Ruth\\'s next donation will probably be her last. Ruth suggests that she and Kathy take a trip and bring Tommy with them. During the trip, Ruth expresses regret for keeping Kathy and Tommy apart. Attempting to make amends, Ruth hands them Madame\\'s address, urging them to seek a deferral. Shortly afterwards, Ruth makes her second donation and completes, an implied euphemism for dying.  Kathy becomes Tommy\\'s carer and they begin a romantic relationship. Encouraged by Ruth\\'s last wishes, they go to Madame\\'s house to see if they can defer Tommy\\'s fourth donation, bringing Tommy\\'s artwork with him to support their claim that they are truly in love. They find Madame at her house, and also encounter Miss Emily, their former headmistress, who lives with her. The two women reveal that Hailsham was an experiment to give clones humane treatment, in contrast to other institutions. The gallery was used to help get funding, by conveying to the outside world that clones are in fact human beings, with creative skills and interests. However, they cannot help Kathy and Tommy get a deferral, because there is actually no such provision.  Tommy knows that his next donation will be his last, and confronts Kathy about her work as a carer. She resigns from being Tommy\\'s carer and does not see him again. The novel ends with Kathy alone after Tommy\\'s \"completion,\" having been told that she herself is soon to start her donations. '"

       "' List of To Kill a Mockingbird characters The story takes place during three years (1933–35) of the Great Depression in the fictional \"tired old town\" of Maycomb, Alabama, the seat of Maycomb County.
